OMERO.omero_parade2
==================================

OMERO parade re-implemented with the mosaic framework.

Installation
============

This section assumes that an OMERO.web is already installed. See [OMERO.web installation instructions]<https://github.com/ome/omero-web/blob/master/README.rst> for more details.

Installing from Pypi
--------------------

Install the app using [pip](<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>) .

Ensure that you are running ``pip`` from the Python environment
where ``omero-web`` is installed. Depending on your install, you may need to
call ``pip`` with, for example: ``/path/to_web_venv/venv/bin/pip install ...``

::

    $ pip install -U omero-parade2


Development mode
----------------

Install `omero-parade2` in development mode as follows:

    # within your python venv:
    $ cd omero-parade2
    $ pip install -e .

After installation either from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/) or in development mode, you need to configure the application.
To add the application to the `omero.web.apps` settings, run the following command:

Note the usage of single quotes around double quotes:

    $ omero config append omero.web.apps '"omero_parade2"'

Optionally, add a link "OMERO Parade 2" at the top of the webclient to
open the index page of this app:

    $ omero config append omero.web.ui.top_links '["OMERO Parade 2", "omero_parade2_index", {"title": "Open OMERO Parade 2 in new tab", "target": "_blank"}]'


Now restart your `omero-web` server and go to
<http://localhost:4080/omero_parade2/> in your browser.


Further Info
============

1. This app was derived from [cookiecutter-omero-webapp](https://github.com/ome/cookiecutter-omero-webapp).
2. For further info on deployment, see [Deployment](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero/developers/Web/Deployment.html)

# React + Vite (from vite app)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
